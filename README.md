# EBYTE
Libraries to program and use EBYTE wireless data transceivers. These transceivers are samll low power units that work well with Teensy or Arduino micorcontrollers. The company cByte makes several different versions for different power, frequency, and other parameters. While these units may come with a small adapter or progrqmming via USB, this library will lot you re-program them via a sketch. Methods are also included to let you send data structures to simplify sending data.'

These units generally consume very low power unless transmitting and have very good range that matches their cataloged range.
